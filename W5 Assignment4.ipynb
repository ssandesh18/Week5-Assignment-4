    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently. The operating system can then allocate all these threads or processes to the processor to run them parallelly, thus improving the overall performance and efficiency.\n",
    "Why Use Multiprocessing In Python?\n",
    "Performing multiple operations for a single processor becomes challenging. As the number of processes keeps increasing, the processor will have to halt the current process and move to the next, to keep them going. Thus, it will have to interrupt each task, thereby hampering the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it as an employee in an organization tasked to perform jobs in multiple departments. If the employee has to manage the sales, accounts, and even the backend, he will have to stop sales when he is into accounts and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are different employees, each to perform a specific task. It becomes simpler, right? Thatâ€™s why multiprocessing in Python becomes essential. The smaller task threads act like different employees, making it easier to handle and manage various processes. A multiprocessing system can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A system with more than a single central processor\n",
    "A multi-core processor, i.e., a single computing unit with multiple independent core processing units\n",
    "In multiprocessing, the system can divide and assign tasks to different processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.In Multiprocessing, CPUs are added for increasing computing power.\tWhile In Multithreading, many threads are created of a single process for increasing computing power.\n",
    "2.In Multiprocessing, Many processes are executed simultaneously.\tWhile in multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously.\n",
    "3.Multiprocessing are classified into Symmetric and Asymmetric.\tWhile Multithreading is not classified in any categories.\n",
    "4.In Multiprocessing, Process creation is a time-consuming process.\tWhile in Multithreading, process creation is according to economical.\n",
    "5.In Multiprocessing, every process owned a separate address space.\tWhile in Multithreading, a common address space is shared by all the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a python code to create a process using the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine. It runs on both POSIX and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the individual process IDs involved, here is an expanded example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from multiprocessing import Process\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "def info(title):\n",
    "    print(title)\n",
    "    print('module name:', __name__)\n",
    "    print('parent process:', os.getppid())\n",
    "    print('process id:', os.getpid())\n",
    "\n",
    "def f(name):\n",
    "    info('function f')\n",
    "    print('hello', name)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    info('main line')\n",
    "    p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))\n",
    "    p.start()\n",
    "    p.join()\n",
    "        \n",
    "Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing Pools in Python\n",
    "The multiprocessing.pool.Pool class provides a process pool in Python.\n",
    "The multiprocessing.pool.Pool class can also be accessed by the alias multiprocessing.Pool. They can be used interchangeably.\n",
    "It allows tasks to be submitted as functions to the process pool to be executed concurrently. Python multiprocessing Pool can be used for parallel execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism).\n",
    "The multiprocessing module also introduces APIs which do not have analogs in the threading module. A prime example of this is the Pool object which offers a convenient means of parallelizing the execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism). The following example demonstrates the common practice of defining such functions in a module so that child processes can successfully import that module. This basic example of data parallelism using Pool,\n",
    "\n",
    "from multiprocessing import Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return x*x\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    with Pool(5) as p:\n",
    "        print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Q5. How can we create a pool of worker processes in python using the multiprocessing module?\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below demonstrates how to configure 60 worker processes using the context manager interface for the multiprocessing.pool.Pool class.\n",
    "# SuperFastPython.com\n",
    "# example of configuring the number of worker processes\n",

    "        # report the status of the pool\n",
    "        print(pool)\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the example configures the process pool to use 60 processes and confirms that it will create 60 processes.\n",
